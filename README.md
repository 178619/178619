Hello, my nickname is Fryze. My friend gave an idea for me. My old nickname was 'Clock' which I made without thinking much. Therefore I still thank my friend for making such a nice nickname, although we... Well, my ID 178619 was from my old nickname, and when 'clock' was obviously taken in the most websites my idea was to use atomic numbers - Cl to 17, O to 8, C to 6 and K to 19. (I know that sounds stupid, but I was 11 at the point...) I already changed my nickname for the most websites, but I didn't change mine here until now as all of my repos are private and I had no reason to care my profile. But after I have made a pull request once, I think it wouldn't hurt to fix the issue at once. That's why I am also writing this.



My projects:
* PRTS - Arknights Tools App for Android ([on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.floatick.arknightshelper))
  * Well, since I played Arknights a lot, I was seeking for some Arknights tools. And then I realized most of them are either not supporting Korean, discontinued or hard to use. So I decided to make my own one, and I thought it would be better if it is an app. Before this I was completely new to creating apps(well, it's not like I am good at programming, but I knew literally nothing about how to make an app) but somehow I could make a basic app with React Native. Now it has some useful tools and supports Korean, English and Chinese (though the quality for Chinese is lame as I had to use machine translations...) I hope I can improve my app further.
  * I am seeking for an alternative name... I really should stop using the name PRTS as PRTS Wiki exists, but I have no idea for a new name. I seriously need to think about it...
* My own personal blog, made with Python for the backend and HTML+CSS+Javascript for the frontend (and Google Firebase for auth/database).
  * I am aware that this is merely a waste of time and effort if I only wanted to have a blog, but I wanted to make mine myself for some reason... like an achievement? Well, I did learn a lot from making this so it wasn't a bad deal at all. I am still updating it.
  * I am not linking my website in a million years! Showing my posts to others would be so embarrassing... I know it's dumb as blog is supposed to be public, but... just no.

Old Projects:
* [Infinitode 2 Leaderboards Website](https://infinitode.floatick.com/) (Development Discontinued, Online)
  * Pretty much same with my blog. Actually, this was made before I have created my blog. Infinitode 2 is a nice tower defence game overall and it helped me a lot in an unexpected way. I'd say my personality changed a lot while I was in the community of this game. Nonetheless I had to leave it one day. Sad.
* Infinitode 2 Leaderboards Discord Bot (Development Discontinued, Offline - replaced with another)
  * I loved the game and its community so I wanted to contribute in a way, and I can say I did help lots of people in the community with this. I have put so much time and effort for this project. It served people for more than an year. I also improved it by adding profile command that prints a cool image, a verification system that links the game account to its owner's discord account, etc. It stayed online for months even after I left the community. I turned it off when an alternative by another person was introduced to the server. I hope it's going well.
* Another website for a game (Discontinued)
  * It was a damage calculator. I'd not talk so much about this one, I hate that game and my project at this point.
* Suiris - A discord bot (Discontinued)
  * Well, it didn't do anything much. However this one is how I got into Python, so it does have a meaning, even though it was discontinued very fast.

Langauges:
* Korean (Native)
  * 유창한 한국어를 구사합니다만 성격 탓에 제대로 된 대화는 힘들지도 모릅니다. 인터넷상에서야 문제 없겠지만요. 뭐 현실에서 만날 일도 없으니, 그냥 한국어 잘 쓴다고 생각해주세요.
* English (Barely Usable)
  * I can read English text, but I can't write very well. Also I am sure I will be panicked when someone tries to talk with me in English...

I do not know if you seriously wasted your time on reading this. You might have simply scrolled down to the end. I would have been surprised if I found that you are reading this sentence, but you know, although 'You' are surely reading this, I do not know if 'You' exist.

Well, my posts are usually gibberish like this. This is exactly why I did not link my blog here. I really am a terrible writer afterall.

And 'You' surely wasted their time. Well done, thank 'You' for reading. 'You' might be as stupid as me. I mean... sorry for wasting your time?
